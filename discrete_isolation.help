Calculates the discrete isolation distance for points with numerical attributes. The isolation is the distance from one point to the closest point with a higher attribute value. As attribute value can be used every numerical attribute e.g., the elevation (for peaks) or the population (for populated places). The isolation distance is always calculated in meters based on the ellipsoid.

The tool needs a single part point layer with a numerical attribute column and an empty numerical column for storing the isolation distance. Measure is always meters on the ellipsoid. NULL-values result with an isolation of 0.  For the point with the highest numerical attribute value is the number from the maximal isolation value used
