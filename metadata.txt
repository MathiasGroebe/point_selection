about=
	This plugin contains tools for the calculation of measures to select points in the process of cartographic generalization. Generally, it helps to find the local maximum or minimum. This function is also useable for analytic purposes.
	Calculates the discrete isolation distance for points with numerical attributes. The concept is similar to the topographic isolation, but it uses only the points and not the terrain as continuous surfaces. The isolation is the distance from one point to the closest point with a higher attribute value. As attribute value can be used e.g., the elevation (for peaks) or the population (for populated places). By graduating the points by the isolation you can reach nearly spatially equally distributed point visualization, which can be also combined with other attributes. 
	As another approach the functional importance method from Hormann is implemented. In this case the population and a diameter creates a function, which is compared with all points and the difference of function values is stored in the attribute table. If the value is greater zero, the point should be shown but can also graduate by the values. 
	The label grid function selects the point with the highest value in a grid cell. First used by MapBox and implemented in PostgreSQL/PostGIS now in QGIS. The grid stays invisible and is created by the tool.
