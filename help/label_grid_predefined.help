Uses a predefined polygon or grid and check which point is contained by which polygon or grid cell. Afterward, the highest (Max option) point or the lowest (Min option) value in each polygon will set to 1, the second-highest/lowest 2, and so on. You can use the resulting ranking of the points and showing one, two, three, or more features in each grid cell.The value 0 means no ranking.

Please provide two numerical columns for storing the grid cell's id and none for holding the selection. The column for the grid id can be used for inspection; a value of -1 means that the point lies in no grid cell.
