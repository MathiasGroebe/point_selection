Calculates the discrete isolation distance for points with numerical attributes. The isolation is the distance from one point to the closest point with a higher (Max option) or lowest (Min option) attribute value. As attribute value can be used every numerical attribute, e.g., the elevation (for peaks) or the population (for populated places). The isolation distance can be calculated in meters based on the ellipsoid per default or cartesian in the CRS units.

The tool needs a single part point layer with a numerical attribute column and an empty numerical column for storing the isolation distance. NULL-values result in an isolation value of 0, and the isolation is always measured in meters on the ellipsoid. The point with the highest numerical attribute value is the number from the maximal isolation value used.
